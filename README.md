# Snake Game
#### This is a classic snake game including:
* A Special Snake featuring various shades of green color.
* Fruits popping at random points(but for a limited amount of time) to power up and increase the score.

#### How to play:
* Clone the repository.
* Firstly install the latest version of python in your device from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
* Run the command `pip install pygame` or `pip3 install pygame`. This will download the pygame library. 
* Now, run `python main.py`, you will see a pop-up window coming, which is the game.

#### Rules:
* The scoring is based on the number of fruits the snake eats and type of fruits.
* The red one fetches you 1 point and the length of the snake by 1, similarly blue and yellow fetch you 2 and 4 points respectively.
* The snake starts with length 1, score 0 and if the snake collides with itself then it dies and game is over.
* If the snake hits the boundaries then also it dies.
* You can choose to "Play Again" or "Quit". If you play again, highest score will be displayed on top right corner for the chances you played.

#### Controls:
* `Up`: for changing direction to upwards
* `Down`: for changing direction to downwards
* `Right`: for changing direction to rightwards
* `Left`: for changing direction to leftwards
